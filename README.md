# NYC Linguistic Diversity Map

> This project will become an interactive map of New York Cityâ€™s linguistic
> diversity, using data collected by the Endangered Language Alliance (ELA).
> Users will need to be able to query a rich dataset and interact with the data
> through an interactive map that may consist of audio, video, and storymap
> links. The long-term vision for this project is to create an open source
> toolkit documenting the workflows and tools used to enable others to undertake
> language mapping in their own communities.

## Setup and requirements

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with `--typescript`. In order
to develop it, you will need a few items.

### Software

In order to use this project locally, you must have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [`yarn` package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/)

Setup and installation steps are available on each website.

### Mapbox API key

In order to use Mapbox features including background layers, vector tiles, and
place search, follow these steps:

1. [Create a Mapbox account](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) if needed.
2. [Create an access
   token](https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/overview/tokens/#creating-and-managing-access-tokens).
3. Create a file called _.env_ in this directory.
4. Add the following to it, replacing `YOUR_TOKEN` with the Mapbox token you
   just created:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN='YOUR_TOKEN'
   ```

## Usage

### Install dependencies

In the project directory, run `yarn` to install the project's `npm`
dependencies. It should take a lot less time to install after the first run.

### Develop

In the project directory, run `yarn start` to run the app in a local web server
visible at[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will automatically reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint
errors in the console.

### Test

`yarn test` launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the
section about [running
tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### Build

`yarn build` builds the app for production in a _./build_ folder in this
directory. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the
best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include cache-busting
hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.
